A Node library to insert segments from an HLS VOD (e.g. ad) into another HLS VOD.

## Installation

```
npm install --save @eyevinn/hls-splice
```

## Usage

The code below shows an example of how an ad (HLS VOD) is inserted 35 seconds from the start in an HLS VOD.

```javascript
const hlsVod = new HLSSpliceVod('https://maitv-vod.lab.eyevinn.technology/stswe17-ozer.mp4/master.m3u8');
hlsVod.load()
.then(() => {
  return hlsVod.insertAdAt(35000, 'https://maitv-vod.lab.eyevinn.technology/ads/apotea-15s.mp4/master.m3u8');
})
.then(() => {
  const mediaManifest = hlsVod.getMediaManifest(4928000);
  console.log(mediaManifest);
})
```

This example below illustrates what this library does. Consider this HLS VOD:

```
#EXTM3U
#EXT-X-TARGETDURATION:9
#EXT-X-ALLOW-CACHE:YES
#EXT-X-PLAYLIST-TYPE:VOD
#EXT-X-VERSION:3
#EXT-X-MEDIA-SEQUENCE:1
#EXTINF:9.000,
segment1_0_av.ts
#EXTINF:9.000,
segment2_0_av.ts
#EXTINF:9.000,
segment3_0_av.ts
#EXTINF:9.000,
segment4_0_av.ts
#EXTINF:9.000,
segment5_0_av.ts
#EXTINF:9.000,
segment6_0_av.ts
#EXTINF:9.000,
segment7_0_av.ts
#EXTINF:9.000,
segment8_0_av.ts
#EXTINF:9.000,
segment9_0_av.ts
#EXTINF:6.266,
segment10_0_av.ts
#EXT-X-ENDLIST
```

and with this library we can insert this HLS VOD (ad):

```
#EXTM3U
#EXT-X-TARGETDURATION:3
#EXT-X-ALLOW-CACHE:YES
#EXT-X-PLAYLIST-TYPE:VOD
#EXT-X-VERSION:3
#EXT-X-MEDIA-SEQUENCE:1
#EXTINF:3.000,
ad1_0_av.ts
#EXTINF:3.000,
ad2_0_av.ts
#EXTINF:3.000,
ad3_0_av.ts
#EXTINF:3.000,
ad4_0_av.ts
#EXTINF:3.000,
ad5_0_av.ts
#EXT-X-ENDLIST
```

and get this result:

```
#EXTM3U
#EXT-X-TARGETDURATION:9
#EXT-X-ALLOW-CACHE:YES
#EXT-X-PLAYLIST-TYPE:VOD
#EXT-X-VERSION:3
#EXT-X-MEDIA-SEQUENCE:1

```javascript
class HLSSpliceVod {
  /**

   */
  load(): Promise<void>
  /**
   * Insert ad located at `adMasterManifestUri` at position `offset` (milliseconds)
   */

  /**
   * Insert an ad opportunity according to interstitial DATERANGE schema at position `offset` (milliseconds)
   */
  insertInterstitialAt(offset: number, id: string, uri: string, isAssetList: boolean): Promise<void>
